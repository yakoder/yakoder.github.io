When unsubscribing from newsletters: "It can take up to 10 days to process changes."
    - This is technically a lie.  Orders don't take "10 days" to process, they are processed immediately.  Newsletter (new) subscriptions don't take "10 days" to add them to the list.  So it it technically possible for removals to be processed immediately.  The only reason -- the **only** reason -- companies _purposefully_ delay removal from mailing lists is so that they can **force unwanted SPAM** on people who have made it clear they _do not want SPAM_.
