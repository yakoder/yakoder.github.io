* Constant consistency creates clarity.
    - If you cannot be consistent, then you will create confusion.
* Learn to help yourself.
    - If you didn't do your own research, don't ask others.
* Learn how to be patient.
    - Don't be the forum poster who asks again after less than an hour.
    - Don't assume others _must_ answer you.
* Know when to ask others for help.
    - Not every solution is online, sometimes you find a response-less forum post from 5 years ago that exactly matches your issue.
    - Sometimes issue resolution time is more important.
* The right music helps, the wrong music hurts.
    - If you have the right music playing for your current mood, your creative energies will flow.
    - If you have the wrong music playing for your current mood, you will not be productive as the music will increasingly annoy you.
* If you only look at what a person has done professionally, you'll never see the full person's knowledge.
    - People know more than what they did at any given job.
    - That knowledge is never going to be on a resume, because it is not from a job &mdash; and that is the only information on a work history (resume).
